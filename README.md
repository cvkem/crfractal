# CloudRun demo (fract-http) 

This is a set of tools to research performance aspects of CloudRun and can also be used to demo how to work with it.



The fractal code example is based on a [redit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/jy9kq6/a_fractal_i_rendered_in_go_without_any_external/)
My code is based on a [repo](https://github.com/hvpeteet/golang-fractal-generator) by Henry Peteet, however it has been modified to support the concurrent processing over http.
